      <p className="mb-4">Last updated: 23 November 2025</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">1. Does Skilcenta Offer Refunds?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Skilcenta acts as a <strong>payment transfer platform</strong> in the marketplace.
        Payments are collected by Skilcenta and then forwarded to the seller after the order is confirmed.
        However, <strong>Skilcenta does NOT issue refunds</strong>. All refunds are entirely managed and
        decided by the seller.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2. Marketplace Purchases</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        While Skilcenta facilitates payments, the actual transaction (product quality, delivery, returns)
        remains a <strong>buyer–seller agreement</strong>. Skilcenta is not responsible for disputes regarding
        product condition or delivery.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Skilcenta collects payment and transfers it to the seller.</li>
        <li><strong>Refunds, returns, or replacements are the seller’s responsibility only.</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">3. Refunds, Returns, or Product Issues</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If a buyer receives a damaged, inaccurate, or misleading product, the buyer must
        contact the seller directly. Skilcenta does not control seller decisions regarding refunds.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If a seller refuses to respond or repeatedly behaves dishonestly, users may report it to:
        <strong> skilcenta.contact@gmail.com</strong>. Based on severity, Skilcenta may:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Remove the listing</li>
        <li>Warn the seller</li>
        <li>Suspend or permanently ban the seller</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">4. Digital Resources</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        All digital study materials (notes, PDFs, resources) on Skilcenta are free. Since no payment is
        collected for digital content, refunds do not apply.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">5. Reporting Issues</h2>
      <p className="mb-8">
        To report fraud, misleading listings, or abusive behavior, contact us at
        <strong> skilcenta.contact@gmail.com</strong>. While Skilcenta cannot issue refunds,
        we will review the situation and take appropriate action against the seller.
