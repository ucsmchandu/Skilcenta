      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        These Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of Skilcenta (the
        "Platform"), a student-centric platform providing an AI chatbot, a
        student-to-student marketplace, resource sharing, and skill roadmaps. By
        accessing or using Skilcenta, you agree to these Terms. If you do not
        agree, do not use the Platform.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You must be at least 13 years old to use Skilcenta. By using the
        Platform you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement and
        that any information you provide is accurate.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Account Registration</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To access certain features you must create an account. You are
        responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
        credentials and for all activity under your account. Notify us
        immediately at skilcenta.contact@gmail.com of any unauthorized use.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Marketplace Terms</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The marketplace enables users to list, buy, and sell second-hand items.
        Skilcenta acts as a <strong>payment facilitator</strong> between buyers
        and sellers. Buyers pay through Skilcenta, and Skilcenta transfers the
        payment to the seller after the order is confirmed.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Skilcenta does NOT inspect items, verify product condition, guarantee
        authenticity, or control delivery. All product quality, delivery
        responsibility, and refund decisions are solely handled by the seller.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Refunds are NOT provided by Skilcenta.</li>
        <li>
          Skilcenta may take action against dishonest sellers (warnings,
          removal, bans).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">
        5. User Content and Resource Sharing
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Users may upload notes, PDFs, images, and other resources. By uploading,
        you grant Skilcenta a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to store,
        display, and distribute the content on the Platform. You represent that
        you have the right to upload the content and that it does not infringe
        third-party rights. Skilcenta may remove content that violates these
        Terms.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">6. AI Chatbot</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The AI chatbot provides educational assistance and suggestions. It is an
        aid and may not always be accurate or appropriate. Do not rely solely on
        the chatbot for critical decisions. We may store chatbot interactions to
        improve service quality and to prevent misuse, subject to our Privacy
        Policy.
      </p>

        Platform will cease, but certain information may be retained as required
